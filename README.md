# Interactive Boxes

This project was created as part of the **Frontend Technical Support assessment task**.  
It demonstrates the use of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to build a simple interactive webpage with three expandable boxes.

- The webpage contains **three boxes** placed at the top, middle, and bottom of the page.
- When a user **clicks on a box**, it expands dynamically and displays **options for colors and sizes**.
